hi! 

TO RUN THE PROJECT:
just run ./el-goog 
then check out localhost:5000 in a web browser

TO REBUILD THE PROJECT:
youll need to fetch nodejs modules and install golang
follow the readme.md for golang setup
then simply run ./rebuild.sh
rebuild.sh does all the necessary steps after your golang environment is
configured


golang backend files are in the root directory to package main

web assets are in assets/static, and webpack also copies them to assets/dist
javascript jsx files are in assets/src



el-goog allows you to create, login, edit and delete an account
with your account, you own a file directory and can create and delete folders
within each folder, you can upload and delete files!
